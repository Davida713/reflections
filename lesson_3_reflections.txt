When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to work with others or create a place where it is backed up online soyou can access it anywhere. 


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you will sometimes be in the middle of making a change and it will have to keep track of the changes if they update automattically. You should intentionally save when at a logical stopping point.
