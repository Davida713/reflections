What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a git file that runs git in the background. 


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area bundles the commit together before you send it to the repo. I think it could catch things before you send it to the repo.
