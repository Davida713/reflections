What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a git file that runs git in the background. 


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area bundles the commit together before you send it to the repo. I think it could catch things before you send it to the repo.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

It will show you the changes being made and you can check them. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

When you want to test a weird change or when you want to create a parralle version.
